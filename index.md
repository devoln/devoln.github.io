## About me

Hey! My name is Alexander Volnov and I'm a software engineer.

My main areas of interest are:
1. Graphics programming and game engine development
2. Generic code and metaprogramming
3. Software optimization
4. Procedural generation (audio synthesis, textures and 3D models)
5. Library development

I develop software in:
1. C++ (most of my projects)
2. Go (backend for my web projects)
3. JavaScript (frontend for my web projects)
4. Other programming languages (Java for small Android apps, C# for small Windows-only GUI-utils, etc)

Usually, I avoid using any high-level libraries, engines and frameworks unless they are really small and easy to learn and modify. So I mostly write my code using low-level libraries including but not limited to:
1. OpenGL (or OpenGL ES, WebGL as its subsets)
2. Various Windows APIs
3. Posix and Linux APIs

See my projects in the [Projects](/projects) section or in [my GitHub account](https://github.com/devoln).

I strongly believe that code reuse by using libraries is broken. This is why I avoid third-party libraries so much. Inability to reuse code is the root issue in the software industry that leads to bloated software with exponentially growing complexity. I feel that it affects libraries written by me as well, so this isn't just a so-called NIH (not invented here) syndrome.

In my projects, I constantly look for ways to write less code that does more things without sacrificing its efficiency. I try to achieve this by leveraging metaprogramming to make code more generic, composable and reusable. My experience shows that it works really well but the deeper I go the more difficult it becomes to continue.

My dream is to make a revolution in software development by creating a new technology that will allow unlimited code reuse. This is the long-term goal of my projects and I've been researching this for a long time. Particularly, [Intra's](/projects/Intra) `dev-next` branch is a test area for most of my ideas about code composability. I also have an early on-paper draft describing a programming language specifically designed for code reuse.
