When I was a child, Sonic was one of my favorite games. This is why I decided to try to create something like it.

Screenshots should allow you to quickly evaluate how "great" my art is.
If you want to look at it closer, feel free to download the game.

Controls:

- Arrows - move the character.
- ESC - quit the game

Note: the game is not translated into English, it was initially created for Russian speakers.
